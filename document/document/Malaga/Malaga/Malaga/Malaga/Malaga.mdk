[TITLE]

## When this approach can be used

* **At Pre-design and Design stages**:
   Alternative solutions are examined at feasibility or design stage.
   Consequences weight is evaluated comparing different configurations under the same hypothesis.
   
* **During the lifecycle of the Infrastructure (Managament stage)**:
   When an update normative context obliges modifications in existing operas, impact could be measured through quantitative methods.

## Fire Engineering as intersections of other discplines   
* Architectural
* Civil Works
* Mechanical Ventilation

## Methodology   

* Through a multiscale approach combining 1D and CFD + evacuation analyses it is possible to evaluate the interaction between people and combustion products 


## CASE 1

## Tunnel Characteristics   
* two way tunnel
* transversal ventilation logic
* evacuation system is provided of ventilated refuges

## Fire Scenario Hypothesis
